List your non-negotiables: Write everything you consider a must-have or deal-breaker in a partner. Be exhaustive.\n2. Sort ruthlessly: For each item, ask: 'Could I be deeply happy without this?' If yes, it's a preference. If no, it's a true deal-breaker.\n3. Examine the deal-breakers: For each genuine non-negotiable, write why it's essential. What need does it protect?\n4. Check for rigidity: Are any of your 'requirements' actually defense mechanisms in disguise? (e.g., 'must be independent' = 'must not need me.')\n5. Finalize your list: Write your refined list of 3–5 genuine non-negotiables. These are your compass—hold them, but hold everything else loosely."
